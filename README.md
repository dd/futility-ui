## Oh great, another UI library.

You might be wondering: why the heck do we need yet another UI library? The short answer is: just because.

This library isn\`t necessarily better than others. It has a much smaller community, it evolves more slowly, and it doesn\`t really have any unique killer feature. It exists simply because none of the existing options fully work for me. Either there aren\`t enough components, or they\`re incredibly complicated, or not truly native to Vue, or they\`re paid, orâ€¦ they just look ugly. So, I decided to build my own.

This library grew out of components I use at work. And my colleagues are probably asking themselves: why bother extracting the UI into a separate repo? Here are a few reasons:

* I don\`t like monorepos.

* It\`s easier to isolate components, code style, and dependencies.

* Components are simpler to organize and structure.

* Writing documentation is easier when you build components outside the context of the main project.

* A separate repo makes it simpler to set up tests, build processes, and all that stuff. (Yeah, yeah - I know there are no tests yet, but eventually I\`ll add some, at least out of curiosity.)

* You can improve the UI independently from the main project.

* It helps keep the main project\`s codebase cleaner - less clutter unrelated to business logic.

* Reusability? That\`s a cliche argument, and it\`s not really the main goal here (But who knows - maybe I\`ll use this library in other projects too. I already have a few ideas).

* An attempt to turn legacy code into a documented library that anyone can use.
